# onthemap

On the map is my third project that I was studying Mapkit and working with API on Udacity course.

STEP:
1. Open application
2. If you do not have an Udacity account then tap signup button
3. Login to application
4. The map will show the recent 100 pins from students around the world.
5. If you tap on pin, it will show student name and link that will link to their website
6. On the top right, you can see refresh button and add button.
    - Refresh button is to reload data from server and re-pins onto the map
    - Add button that will take you to add locatio view
7. Enjoy with my application
